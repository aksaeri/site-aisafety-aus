summary: >-
  Sparked by the return of EAGx Australia to Melbourne, this in-person event is
  a unique opportunity to meet and engage with members of the AI safety
  community from around the country, and to discuss and develop initiatives that
  help mitigate risks from frontier AI systems.


  The "unconference" format means that attendees will drive the agenda; nominating sessions they wish to lead or attend. These sessions are then voted on and flexibly allocated to meeting spaces. This format harnesses the collective talents of the attendees, encourages collaboration, and stimulates interactive sessions that are tailored to the interests and expertise of the participants.
