I use applied behaviour science and social science methods to understand and address complex challenges, including climate change, pandemics, and advanced artificial intelligence.

I am especially interested in how to improve decision-making and behaviour about the development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence to address catastrophic risks and safely transition to futures where advanced AI is widely used.
